# nomis-tailer

A Clojure library for tailing growing files. Understands rollover.

Good for tailing log files.

Similar to `tail -F` in some Unix's.


## Usage


### Dependencies

For a Leiningen project, use the following dependency:

```
[com.nomistech/nomis-tailer "0.1.0"]
```

Add the following to your `ns` declaration:

```
(:require [nomis-tailer.core :as tailer])
```

### Tailing a Single File

Use `tailer/make-tailer-and-channel` to create a `tailer-and-channel`.

The tailing starts from the end of the file.

Use `tailer/channel` to get a core.async channel to take from. The values taken
will be successive lines from the file.

Use `tailer/close!` to close a `tailer-and-channel`.


### Tailing Using a File Pattern

Use `tailer/make-multi-tailer-and-channel` to create a `multi-tailer-and-channel`.

Looks for the most recent file in `dir` that matches `pattern` and looks
for new files every `file-change-delay-ms`.

The tailing starts from the end of any current file, and includes the
full content of subsequent files.

Use `tailer/channel` and `tailer/close!` as for `tailer-and-channel`.
